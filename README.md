# TEMPOmap

This repository contains scripts for the '**Spatiotemporally resolved single-cell transcriptomics reveals kinetic sculpting of RNA life cycle**'. 

1. ```Image processing``` (Image registration, spot calling, and barcode filtering)
2. ```Cell processing``` (RNA cytoplasmic translocation modeling and estimation in HeLa cells)
3. ```Kinetic analysis``` (RNA kinetic parameter modeling and estimation (including synthesis, degradation, nuclear export) in HeLa cellsï¼Œhuman induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cariomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and primary human skin cells)
4. ```Other cell lines``` (other data processing and RNA cytoplasmic translocation modeling and estimation in hiPSC-CM and skin cell dataset)
